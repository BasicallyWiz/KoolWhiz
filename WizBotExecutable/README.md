# Is this the bot?
No. The bot is the library. This folder is just a project meant to run the bot in a basic console.

Feel free to replace this entire project with your own, be it another console app, or full-on app with a UI. Not that there's much merit to a UI as the bot is right now. But then again, the whole thing's open-source so go wild. Anything helps.
