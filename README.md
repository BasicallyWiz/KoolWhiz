# KoolWhiz Project (WizBot)
Little project I made primarily to archive the gogs. All of them.<br/>This also just so happens to be the successor of [this piece of shit](https://github.com/BasicallyWiz/WizBot), because I don't like JavaScript all that much.

## Bot Configuration
All configuration for the bot should be set in /Running Directory/BotData.xml, a file that will be made when you run the app.

If you fail to set ClientToken attribute, the app will be unuseable altogether.
